Lyrics:
FAR EASTERN onward
Beloved Alma Mater!
Onward, Oh lead us.
The green and gold in view;
In thy happy halls
Our young hearts saw the light;
Command thy sons and daughters
To battle for the right
Though far from home our feet may roam
Our love will still be true;
Our voices shall unite
To praise thy name anew!
We'll treasure within our hearts
The FEU
We'll treasure within our hearts
The FEU

#### THE FEU PRAYER
Direct, O God we beseech Thee
All our actions by Thy Holy inspiration
And help them on by
Thy gracious assistance
So that every prayer and work of ours
May begin with Thee and
By Thee happily ended.
Amen.

## FEU History

At a time when only Americans could practice accounting, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Sr., who obtained his Doctor of Philosophy from Columbia University, envisioned a school that would develop Filipino accountants. He founded Far Eastern University, which was affordable for the middle and working classes.

**What happened in 1928?** Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Sr., together with an eminent group of educators from the University of the Philippines, founded the Institute of Accountancy that offered a three-year program designed to meet the minimum requirements for the certified public accountants’ examinations.

### THE UNIVERSITY EMBLEMS
###### THE UNIVERSITY SEAL
The FEU Coat of Arms consists principally of an eight pointed star representing the resurrection and FEU being the Star of the East- being contiguously shedding its light and luster dedicated to the education of the total man.
###### THE UNIVERSITY COLORS
The University colors are green and gold. Gold represents the golden opportunity for the University to serve the youth and her alumni to serve the country. Green is for hope, representing Rizal’s “Fair hope of the Fatherland.”

###### UNIVERSITY FONT
The Dellarobia BT is the official font of FEU. In the past, FEU’s official font was inspired by the Baybayin, a pre-colonial writing system primarily used by Tagalogs in the northern Philippines.

###### THE MEMORIAL SQUARE
The Nicanor Reyes Memorial Square is a Manila landmark and a favorite backdrop for picture-taking in the campus. Erected in memory of the University Founder and First President, it consists of a 65-foot flagpole on a platform surrounded on all sides with brass sculpture by sculpture by National Artist Vicente Manansala which interprets the late founder’s philosophy of education. It was declared in 2018 as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum.

###### THE TAMARAW
The tamaraw, known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis, is the mascot of every FEU athletic team and the pet name of every student. It is a rare animal found only in Mindoro, Philippines. The tamaraw’s characteristics--one of the most intelligent, pugnacious, and aggressive animals--resembles FEU’s advanced and progressive policy in contemporary education.

###### THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL
The Presidential Seal is displayed in formal and official events where the University President is the host or is scheduled to address an audience. Designed by renowned Filipino artist Dr. Galo B. Ocampo, the seal mainly features the sarimanok ----a legendary bird of the Maranao people of Mindanao.The sarimanok is also part of Philippine mythology which projects the spirit of nationalism upon which the University was founded. Through its harmony of brilliant colors, the iconic mythical bird likewise projects the dynamic unity arising from the diversity of FEU students who come from the country’s various regions.

###### MEMORABILIA
The Memorabilia Room and Archives, located at the Room 402 at the fourth floor of the Administration Building, was set up on November 5, 1984 to honor and perpetuate the memory of Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Sr. It houses a collection of mementos, artifacts, and publications which record milestones in the life of the founder, mementos of previous presidents of the University, and traces the evolution of Far Eastern University through the years.

###### THE MACE
The mace is the symbol of the University and is displayed in official University functions. It consists of a sari-manok holding a kalasag with a superimposed eight-pointed star done in solid bronze and is supported on a finely carved staff made of Philip- pine hardwood. Below the sarimanok is a bamboo scroll with a series of Baybayin letters namely “PA” “E” and “U” representing the acronym “F” “E” “U”. The FEU Coat of Arms signifies the drive of the University in the field of Philippine culture and traditions.
